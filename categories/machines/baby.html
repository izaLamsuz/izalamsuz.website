    <h3>Baby Incubator Premature Baby</h3>
            <li>A neonatal incubator is a rigid box-like enclosure in which an infant can be kept in a controlled environment for observation and care. The device may include a heater, a fan, a container for water to add humidity, a control valve through which oxygen may be added, and acces ports for nursing care. Preterm birth are also known as premature birth, is the birth of the baby at least 37 weeks gestational age. Premature infants are at greater risk for dealays in developmet, hearing problems and visual problems. Incubator is designed to keep baby warm, to mornitor many of their vital body functions like heart rate, blood pressure, oxygen saturation and ton support their breathing if necessary. The main physical variables affecting the incubator environment are temperature, humidity, oxygen saturation, light.</li>
            <h4>Working principle</h4>
                <li>The incubator is provided with motor and fan that sucks the air through it. Then the air-pass on to a heating grid followed by a water evaporator to gain the required humidity. If it is necessary oxygen can be added. The modern incubators are fitted with safety standards, voice, and light alarm indicators of emergency. The three important parameters specify the internal environment of the baby incubator is temperature, humidity, and oxygen concentrations.</li>

                    <p>An infant incubator is a medical device that is used to provide a controlled environment for premature or sick infants. It is particularly essential for infants who have trouble regulating their body temperature or respiratory function. The incubator provides warmth, humidity, and oxygen to help the infant grow and develop.</p>
            
                    <h2>How it Works</h2>
                    <p>An infant incubator typically consists of a clear enclosed plastic or acrylic chamber that allows healthcare providers to observe the infant while protecting them from the outside environment. The inside of the chamber is warm and humid, and usually equipped with several probes that monitor the infant's vital signs such as heart rate, respiratory rate, and oxygen levels.</p>
            
                    <h2>Types of Infant Incubators</h2>
                    <p>There are several types of infant incubators. Open incubators have an open top and provide easy access to the infant. Closed incubators have a transparent head cover, providing less direct contact with the infant and more insulation from external noise and temperature fluctuations. Transport incubators are mobile and designed to transport the infant from one area of a hospital to another or from one hospital to another.</p>
            
                    <h2>Benefits of Infant Incubators</h2>
                    <p>Infant incubators provide several benefits to premature or sick infants. They provide a controlled environment of warmth, humidity, and oxygen, which helps the infant grow and develop. The incubator also provides isolation from outside influences, which could be harmful to the infant, such as infectious diseases, drafts, and noise. Infant incubators have revolutionized the care of premature and sick infants, enabling them to survive and thrive.</p>
            
                    <h2>Conclusion</h2>
                    <p>Infant incubators are an essential medical device for premature or sick infants. They provide a controlled environment that promotes growth and development while protecting the infant from external influences that could be harmful. With ongoing research and development, infant incubators have become smaller, more efficient, and cost-effective, making them more accessible to infants in need.</p>
