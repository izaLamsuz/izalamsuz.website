        Is the instrument that records the electrical activity of the heart Electrocardiogram  (ECG) is the record of that activity.
        <li>As the heart undergoes depolarization and repolarization, the electrical currents that are generated spread not only within the heart,but also throughout the body. </li>
        <li>This electrical activity generated by the heart can be measured by an array of electrodes placed on the body surface. The recorded tracing is called an electrocardiogram (ECG, or EKG). A ”typical” ECG tracing is shown to the right. The different waves that comprise the ECG represent the sequence of depolarization and repolarization of the atria and ventricles. The ECG is recorded at a speed of 25mm/sec (5 large squares/sec), and the voltages are calibrated so that 1 mV = 10 mm (2 large squares) in the vertical direction. Therefore, each small 1-mm square represents 0.04 sec (40 msec) in time and  0.10 mV in voltage. Because the recording speed is standardized, one can calculate the heart rate from the intervals between different waves.</li>
