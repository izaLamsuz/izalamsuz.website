    <h1>
        <u>MAGNETIC RESONANCE IMAGING (<I>MRI</I>) MACHINE</u>
    </h1>
    <li>it is based on Neclear Magnetic REsonance (NMR) certain atomic nuclei demonstrate the ability to absorb and re-emit radiofrequency energy when placed in a magnetic field.</li>
    <h3>An MRI machine has three major layers</h3>
    <li>  Magnetic Bo Field</li>
    Produces a very Homogeneous Magnetic Field.
   <br> (greater) >10,000 time earth's  maGNETIC Field.</br>
    and it's ALWAYS ON
   <br>It adviced to keep away all magnetic objects and it is safe to keep all patient's with metalic objects away with the machine (iron arms, iron legs, cardiac pacemakers)</br>
   <br><li> Gradient coils</li>
   This are the one's responsible with all the sounds that the machine make
   <br>produces a small amount of magnet </br>
   Used to provide contract for diffusion / flow imaging 
   </br>
   <br>   
   <li>RF Coils</li>
   send/receives rf Signals from tissue
   <br>Temporally varying</br>
</br>   
<p>Here are some videos and tips that might help you on your journey with MRI Machine </p>
 <li>Designed for looking at soft tissue, tendons, ligaments, spinal cords, and the brain</li>
<li>Bony structure less detailed compaired to CT Scan</li>
<li>Powered by strong magnetic field</li>
<li>Being inside an MRI is like being inside a large tube. This cause some people to experience claustrophobia or anxiety due to length of the exam. </li>
<li>Lasts at least 30 minutes.</li>
<li>MRI machine make loud noise,so you will receive headphones or earplugs.</li>
<li>You may be asked to hold your breath for time to time.</li>
<li>patient with metal or certain medical implants are not able to undergo MRI's due to magnetic field pulses.</li>

<p>An MRI (magnetic resonance imaging) has three major components</p>
<li>The outer most layer MAGNET:Bo field</li>
It's about >10,000 x Earth's magnetic field. 90% of the MRI is the magnet alone. The magnet is always ON.
<li>Gradient Coils</li>
alters B field in x,y and z localizes the rF signal in space used to provide constract for diffusional/flow imaging and they are also responsible for the loud noises. 
<li>RF Coils</li>
RF Coils sends/receives rF signals to form tissue.
