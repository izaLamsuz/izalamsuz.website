        <h1>PATIENT MONITOR</h1>
        <p><h3>Patient Monitor</h3></p>
      <li>The patient Monitoring System (PMC) is a very critical monitoring systems, it is used for monitoring physiological signals including Electrocardiograph (ECG), Respiration , Invasive and Non-Invasive Blood Pressure, Oxygen Saturation in Human Blood (SpO2), Body Temperature and other Gases etc</li>
      <li>In PMS, the multiple sensor and electrodes is used for receiving physiological signals like as ECG Electrodes, SpO2 Finger Sensor, Blood Pressure Cuff and Temperature Probe to measure the physiological signals.</li>
      <h3>Classes of Patient Monitor system</h3>
      In the past, the dominant products manufactured by medical devices manufacturers are mainly those for single paramater patient monitor is commonly used.
      <li>Single -Paramater Monotoring systems</li>
      <li>Multi-Paramater Patient Monitor systems</li>
