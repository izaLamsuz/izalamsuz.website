        <h1>BIOMEDICAL ENGINEERING&copy</h1>
        <p>professional field</p>
        <p>biomedical engeering or medical engineering is the application of engineeering principle and design concepts to medicine </p>
        <h1>Job duties</h1>
        <p>bioengineers and biomedical engineers typically do the followin:</p>
        <p>design equipment and device, such as artificial internal organs, replacements for body parts, and machines for diagnosing medical problems. install, maintain, or provide technical support for biomedical equipment.</p>
        <h1>Hardest part</h1>
        <p>Anatomy and physiology are the fundamental aspects of biomedical knowledge. Biomedical engineers must have a clear understanding of these aspects to create efficient treatments and device that work in harmony with the human body. Due to thed <i>Complexity of the body's systems,</i> this can often be a challenging task</p>
        <h1>Job location</h1>
        <p>biomedical engineering work in <i>medical institution, manufacture and research facilities, universities and more.</i> They design surgical robotics tools, implantable medical devices, 3-D printing for organs and other life-saving innovations</p>
        <h1>Future</h1>
        <p>some of the most exciting possibilities of the near future includes:<i>Telesurgery,in which surgical procedures remotely.</i> Tissue engineering for research and development. Medical virtual reality tools that can create more accurate images and models of a patient's body</p>
        <p>A biomedical engineer is a skilled proffesional who uses principle of engineering and biological sciences to design and build health devices and systems. Some exaamples of projects that biomedical engineers may work on include artificial organs, prosthetics, medical instruments or health care delivery systems.</p>
